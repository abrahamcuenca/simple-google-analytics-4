# Simple Google Analytics v4 Plugin

This Simple plugin adds the Google Analytics v4 Global site tag (gtag.js) 
in the header of each page on WordPress.

To retrieve your Measurement ID view your Analytics Property and click Web stream details. 

In the stream details you will see:
- Stream Name
- Stream URL
- Stream ID
- Measurement ID

Copy the `Measurement ID` and paste that value into the Measurement ID field in the Simple Google Analytics 4 Plugin options page.

You can add and maintain tags through a web interface to send data to Google Analytics, as well as other Google and non-Google tools.
